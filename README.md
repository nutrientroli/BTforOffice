# BTforOffice
Implementation of a Behavior Tree System for Office use.

The objective is to be able to design a behavior through a visual graph editor (another project.) and import it via json.
Creating the possibility that workers in other departments will only have to ask you to run (automate) a designed json.

You can, in a modular way, alternate and place tasks according to the expected use. Avoiding to remake code and facilitating the maintenance of it.

The project is an example of implementation. As far as tasks are concerned, they are not intended to be useful in all areas.

Roadmap:
 - BT implementation. (done)
 - Task Template. (done)
 - Json Importer implementation. (done)
 - Dynamic Blackboard. (to do)
